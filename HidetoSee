Description
How about some hide and seek heh?

Look at this image here.

The image is named atbash.jpg.

Extract hidden data with steghide (no passphrase): steghide extract -sf atbash.jpg
wrote extracted data to "encrypted.txt"
cat encrypted.txt
The name of the file atbash.jpg - is a hint to encoding algorithm being used for flag
I used this cipher https://www.dcode.fr/atbash-cipher to decode the text to receive the decoded flag
